# INVESTA

INVESTA is a Flask app built with Python that provides interactive dashboards for innovators and investors to track the growth of startups. The app aims to solve the problem of a lack of a single platform to connect investors, innovators, problems, mentors, and monitor the growth of startups. The app includes a funding and investment dashboard that provides recommendations similar to stock markets.

## Business Challenge Description

Problems are plenty across the globe, and plenty of ideas are evolving fast among young minds. Funding is also available in plenty, and talents are available all over. Loads of mentors are interested in giving their time to mentor the right team. However, there is no mapping platform to connect them all.

## Expected Business Solution

The proposed solution is a single platform for managing and mapping investors, innovators, problems, mentors, and monitoring the growth of startups. The funding and investment dashboard can have similar recommendations to stock markets (just that the startups have not reached the public listing stage yet). Note that the app does not include customers or provide business, but can track their revenue and business growth.

The app is built using Flask and Python. The app includes interactive dashboards with AI predictions of startup's growth, with a focus on both mobile and desktop versions.
